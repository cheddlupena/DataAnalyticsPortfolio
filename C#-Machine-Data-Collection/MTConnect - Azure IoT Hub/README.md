MTConnect Data Collector

The console application can:
- collect data from multiple CNC lathe machines in real-time and send it to an Azure IoT hub.
- collect data from agent.mtconnect.org, simulate multiple machines and sent data in real-time and send it to an Azure IoT hub.

MTConnect is a protocol designed for the exchange of data between shop floor equipment and software applications used for monitoring and data analysis. This gives rise to a possibility of having an internet of things architecture for shop floor machine data processing and further analysis.
